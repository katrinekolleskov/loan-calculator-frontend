/*
* I prefer to "centralize" all styling, so that if I want certain elements
* to look and behave in the same way, I have it located in the same place. 
* For example, if I want all input-fields to have one colour or one size,
* I have it in sizes.scss and colors.scss.
*
* If I would have even more similar behavior, say an animated button or
* a button of a very specific style, I'd rather use a scss for the button alone.
* Ex. Button.scss.
